# receeve

create the DynamoDB table, S3 bucket and the process of exporting the DynamoDB table data to that S3 bucket everyday at 2:00 AM UTC time.
Requirements:
Resources should be defined as infrastructure as code (AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK)
If you are going to write some logical code to achieve the needed behavior, then please use Typescript or JavaScript (preferably Typescript)
Some documentation on how to init your solution in AWS plus other comments that you find to be useful to mention

You can get additional points:

also create the automated pipeline to react and deploy the changes to the code of this challenge, like for example some changes to resources, etc., deployment should be triggered on push to the master branch (let’s have only 1 branch for simplicity).
